The Waning Crescent Moon is 
the last phase in the lunar 
cycle. It appears as a 
silver crescent and is when 
you should start to relax 
and not push yourself.

You should finally be at 
piece on this phase and
should feel complete. 
Organise the memories that
you have created and prepare
yourself for the next cycle.
