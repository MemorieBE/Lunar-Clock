During the Third Quarter, 
half of the moon lights up. 
In the Northern Hemisphere, 
the left side is lit up 
and vice versa for the 
Southern Hemisphere.

This is the period where you
should officially cut ties
with things we no longer need.
This is when you should clean
up and let go in order to
make room for new things.
