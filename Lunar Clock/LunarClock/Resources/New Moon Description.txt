The New Moon is the first 
phase of the moon, it is 
also known as the Dark Moon 
and represents new beginnings 
and fresh starts and is when
intentions are created.

This is the period where you 
should try new things and 
start new adventures. It is 
a good time to open yourself 
up for change and be on the 
look out for new opportunities.
