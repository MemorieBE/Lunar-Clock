The Waxing Crescent Moon 
occurs right after the New 
Moon. It appears as a silver
crescent and represents 
growth and gaining strength 
towards goals.

This is the period where
you should start acting
upon the intentions you
made on the New Moon and is
when you should really push
yourself to accomplish.
