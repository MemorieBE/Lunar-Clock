The Waxing Gibbous Moon 
occurs two weeks after the 
New Moon. It is the last
phase before the Full Moon
and is known to be the
less powerful phase.

This phase is the final
push towards your goals.
It is the period where you 
should assess yourself and 
learn from your mistakes
to adapt and overcome.
