During the First Quarter, 
half of the moon lights up. 
In the Northern Hemisphere, 
the right side is lit up 
and vice versa for the 
Southern Hemisphere.

This is the period where you 
should tweak the intentions
made during the New Moon.
Use the momentum of this 
phase to overcome resistences
and make decisions.
