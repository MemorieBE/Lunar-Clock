The Waning Gibbous Moon is 
the phase that comes 
directly after the Full Moon.
It represents letting go and 
beggining the process of
banishing unwanted things.

This is the period where you
should contemplate how far
you've come from your set
intentions. You should
express graditude towards
your accomplishments.
