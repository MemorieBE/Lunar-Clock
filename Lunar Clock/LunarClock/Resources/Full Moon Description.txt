The Full Moon is the phase 
where the moon is the most 
luminant. It occurs when the 
earth finds itself between 
the sun and marks the middle
of the lunar cycle.

This is known to be the most 
powerful phase and is a time 
where everything comes 
together. This is when you
should celebrate everything
that you have achieved.
